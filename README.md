### When NOT to Use ChatGPT

- Ask for a code solution only to copy and paste it into your own work

### When TO use ChatGPT

- Ask to quiz you on your knowledge of any specific tools or languages
- Think of ChatGPT like an intern: very helpful for work that you also are able to fact-check on your own
