### Why Should You Learn the Basics of AI (Even if You Don't Code)

ChatGPT is incredible at creating many different types of content. If your current job involves creating or editing any kind of content, becoming comfortable with AI (and knowing its strengths and weaknesses) can only help you.

### It's a Cliche Already, and it's True

AI will not replace you; people comfortable with AI will.

### Why Was This Repo Written in Python?

Python is one of my favorite languages!

### Can I Use ChatGPT with JavaScript?

Yes, [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO1mwxPNP5A) did a great video on using ChatGPT to build a "Hello, World" React app. You can just ChatGPT with any language!

## Will This Repo be Outdated by the Time I Read This?

In some ways, likely. The goal, however, is to introduce high-level thinking to ChatGPT in ways that will remain consistent with each new release. I will try to note when there are important differences to know between versions.

To see all updates added to ChatGPT so far, please refer to its release notes: <https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes>

### What Version of ChatGPT am I Using?

For simplicity sake, I'm sticking to the free GPT-3. GPT-4 is the advanced paid version, but this guide focuses on the very basics for newcomers.

### A Note on Browsers

In my experience so far, I find that ChatGPT does not play nice with DuckDuckGo, the web browser I usually use. In that spirit, all my examples in this guide are done in Safari.

## How Does ChatGPT Work?

###### [Return to top](#top)

<!-- ### ChatGPT's API

ChatGPT's API Documentation: <https://platform.openai.com/>

#### [Chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat)

NOTE: Only useable for paid versions `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4`. -->

### When NOT to Use ChatGPT

- Ask for a code solution only to copy and paste it into your own work
- When you don't have a question at all; ChatGPT does not respond well to statements (i.e. "Hi" gives you something like "Hello there! How can I assist you today?") so make sure to write your initial prompt in the form of a question

### When TO use ChatGPT

- Ask for basic code as a reference (but again, don't copy and paste)
  - i.e. "Create a basic react component that says hello world. CODE ONLY." You can then add more to it like, "add a button that toggles the visibility of the text," "Now write a test for this app using Playwright," and "document this code." ([Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO1mwxPNP5A))
- Ask to review your code (but again, don't copy and paste its solution)
- Ask to quiz you on your knowledge of any specific tools or languages
- Give it a coding challenge or interview question (and if you get stuck, you can ask it something like "Show me the answer") (NOTE: avoid doing this DURING an interview, unless you've been given the explicit OK to use ChatGPT)
  - i.e "You are conducting an interview for a senior Front End developer role. I want you to ask me difficult React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interview questions. Your response should contain the difficulty rating, but do not give me the answer or any other information. Start by asking me one question." ([Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btc9sRIu2jw))
  - i.e. "Can you give me an HTML question about accessibility." ([Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btc9sRIu2jw))
  - i.e. "Explain JavaScript like I'm a 5-year-old." ([Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO1mwxPNP5A))
  - i.e. "What are the three most important concepts to know in React.js?" ([Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO1mwxPNP5A))
- Think of ChatGPT like an intern: very helpful for work that you also are able to fact-check on your own
- Another metaphor: a tool or language's documentation is its sacred text, and ChatGPT is a pastor or priest who interprets and conveys the text (and should only be taken with a grain of salt)
